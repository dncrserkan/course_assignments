In ps3.py, there is a situation looks like buggy, but it is not.
    When we run simulation for room dimensions 1x1 it start and never stop
    like endless loop. But the reason is speed. In 1x1 room when your speed is 1
    (even if it is smaller than one) our next target will be always out of the room.
    Do notforget the startisng position is randomly choiced. For example:
        starting position: 0.9, 0.9
        speed: 0.11
        direction: 0 degree
            destination point will be: 1.01, 0.9 -> NOT IN THE ROOM

    print ('avg time steps: ' + str(run_simulation(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.0, 50, StandardRobot)))
    print ('avg time steps: ' + str(run_simulation(1, 0.005, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.0, 50, StandardRobot)))
