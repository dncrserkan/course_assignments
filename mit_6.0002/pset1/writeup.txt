In the execution of ps1a.py with the input file ps1_cow_data.txt, 
the following results were observed:

    Number of trips using the greedy algorithm: 6
    Time taken by the greedy algorithm: 0.0

    Number of trips using the brute-force algorithm: 5
    Time taken by the brute-force algorithm: 0.49683356285095215

The dataset in ps1_cow_data.txt contains 10 elements. It's evident 
that the greedy algorithm executes much faster than the brute-force 
algorithm. Despite its speed, the greedy algorithm does not always 
yield the optimal solutionâ€”in this case, the optimal solution is 5. 
However, the greedy algorithm provides a close approximation at a 
significantly faster pace.

Conversely, the brute-force algorithm is slower, especially with 
growing datasets. Nevertheless, it guarantees 100% accuracy in finding 
the optimal solution.
