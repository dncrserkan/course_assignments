Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 
	
	At first Spain has 20% chance of winning, but in third 
	simulation Spain not in the list, but after that their 
	percentage of winning is over 10 percent.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
	
	Based on the answer above I cannot trust 1000 simulations. 
	And It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 
	10.000 times. And I would go with that.
