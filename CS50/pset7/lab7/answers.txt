We can characterize people's audio auras by looking at the properties of their top 100 songs. 
The simplest way to do this is to take the average of some of the songs' properties, such as 
danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, valence, and tempo. We can then assume that the 
person's audio aura is these averages, respectively.

However, there are some problems with this assumption. First, we do not include the standard 
deviation in our calculations. This means that we are not taking into account how much the 
person's listening habits vary. For example, if a person listens to a lot of one music genre, 
but also listens to a few songs from other genres, their audio aura will be biased towards the 
genre they listen to most. To address this problem, we could give more weight to the properties 
of songs that the person listens to more often. For example, if a person listens to more low-valence 
music than high-valence music, we could give the valence property a higher weight when calculating 
their audio aura.

Second, we only consider the person's top 100 songs in our calculations. This means that we are 
ignoring all of the other songs that the person listens to. While this is a good way to save data, 
it is not very accurate. To improve the accuracy of our calculations, we could add more data columns 
to our database, such as the number of times each song has been listened to and the time of day when 
each song was listened to. With this additional data, we could calculate the user's audio aura more 
precisely.

In conclusion, while the simple way of calculating a person's audio aura by taking the average of 
their top 100 songs is a good starting point, there are some ways to improve the accuracy of the 
calculation. By including the standard deviation in our calculations and by considering all of the 
songs that the person listens to, we can get a more accurate picture of their audio aura.
